=== PLAT_Init() ===

This is your platform's initialization function.  It is the very first thing called by EverythingNet.
`main()`'s `argc` and `argv` are passed to it.  The following state is expected after `PLAT_Init()` returns:
- Console output via `putchar`/`puts`/`printf` is safe (even if stubbed)
- `malloc` and `free` are safe (even if stubbed)
- `STATE_Init()` has been called
- `G_State.exitCallbacks.exit` has been set to a valid function pointer, and that function will not return when called
- Attempting to communicate on the network is safe (even if stubbed, or is not garuanteed to succeed, it should not crash)
- `PLAT_Info` has been filled out with appropriate values, and does not contain any NULL pointers
- The graphics subsystem, if necessary, has been initialized
- The audio subsystem, if necessary, has been initialized
- The input subsystem, if necessary, has been initialized
- The networking subsystem, if necessary, has been initialized
